the difference between Event Handlers & addEventListener in JS
=============================================================

Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, 
which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired


- The 2 ways of handling JavaScript Events
---------------------------------------
 1-  By using an event handler
 2-  By adding an event listener


* Event Handler =>
    An event handler can be recognized by the JavaScript using an “EventHandler” property of the object.
    like "onClik" object.onClik


* Event Listener =>
    By adding an event listener to an object, we can catch a wide range of events triggered by the user 
    or the browser like "object.addEventListener(event, function)"


What’s the difference?
    For a given element, you can only have one event handler per event type, 
    but you can have multiple event listeners.

    If you’ll use the first method, event handlers, the difference is that if you add two event handlers for 
    the same button click, the second event handler will overwrite the first and only that event will trigger.
